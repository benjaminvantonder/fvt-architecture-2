                >
                finds its roots in the philosophy of the visionary French
                architect, Le Corbusier. As one of the most influential figures
                in modern architecture, Le Corbusier championed the idea that
                homes should not merely serve as shelters, but as efficient,
                functional living spaces tailored to the needs of daily life. He
                was a pioneer in reimagining urban living, introducing the
                concept of high-density apartment-style housing — a
                revolutionary shift away from traditional single-family homes.
                His innovative thinking helped lay the groundwork for much of
                contemporary architectural practice. Furthermore, Le Corbusier’s
                bold use of exposed concrete gave rise to the architectural
                movement known as Brutalism. This unapologetic embrace of raw
                materials and geometric forms challenged classical aesthetics
                and sparked widespread debate — a testament to his fearless
                experimentation and creative vision. Although Brutalism may
                divide opinions today, the enduring power of his work remains
                undeniable. Masterpieces like the Villa Savoye, with its clean
                lines and open plan layout, and the sculptural Chapel of Notre
                Dame du Haut, with its organic form and spiritual atmosphere,
                continue to inspire architects and design enthusiasts around the
                world.
